            <span><b>About me:</b></span><br />
            I have had quite a diverse range of experiences in my life so far. As a child, I was a professional gymnast. The discipline and dedication I learned from gymnastics have stayed with me and helped shape who I am today.<br />
            <br />
            After my gymnastics days, I attended an art school where I explored various creative avenues. Interestingly, it was during this time that I realized my inclination toward technical skills, particularly in drafting shapes and designs, rather than traditional artistic expression.<br />
            <br />
            My academic journey led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and I dedicated six years to this field. Working as a civil engineer provided me with invaluable experience in solving complex problems related to infrastructure projects. I also gained valuable experience in teamwork and learned how to communicate effectively with various project stakeholders.<br />
            <br />
            However, I have always had a passion for technology and programming, so I decided to pivot my career path. Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in IT, immersing myself in the exciting world of technology, software development, and all digital things.<br />
            <br />
            Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing computer games casually, and I also have a passion for traditional creative activities like sewing and knitting.
